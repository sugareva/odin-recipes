    <p class="description">The best invention italians have made. Lasagnas are a hug to the soul, and the true quintessence of pastas and sauce combined.
        Got tired of the ol' tomato beef lasagnas? Just try this recipe!
    </p>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400°F with a rack in the center position. Line a rimmed sheet pan with foil.
        </li>
        <li>Fill a large pot with water and add 2 teaspoons of the salt. Place over high heat and bring to a boil.
            Add the lasagne and cook until al dente according to the package instructions. Drain.</li>
        <li>Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. When the oil is glistening, add the onions and cook
            until beginning to soften, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute more.
            Add the mushrooms, zucchini, squash, and remaining teaspoon of salt and cook until slightly softened, about 3 minutes.
            Add the spinach and cook until wilted and most of the liquid has evaporated, about another 5 minutes. Turn off the heat. </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, in a medium bowl combine the basil, ricotta, Parmesan, eggs, garlic powder, and pepper.</li>
        <li>Spread ¼ cup of the sauce in a 9 x 13-inch baking dish. Add an even layer of lasagne (see Note),
            then top with ⅓ of the ricotta mixture, spreading out in an even layer. Top with ⅓ of the vegetable mixture.
            Sprinkle with ¾ cup of the grated mozzarella. Repeat with the remaining sauce, lasagne, ricotta mixture, veggies, and mozzarella.</li>
        <li>Cover the baking dish loosely with aluminum foil and place on the prepared sheet. Bake for 30 minutes, then remove the foil and bake,
            uncovered, for about another 20 minutes, or until bubbling and lightly browned. </li>
        <li>Remove the lasagna from the oven and let cool for 10 minutes before serving with Parmesan.</li>
        <li>You waited 10 minutes, sniffing that delicious smell that went to your brain. You know it, you're ready, it's time to enjoy.</li>
    </ol>
