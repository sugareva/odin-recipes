    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>You did the lasagna recipe. The belly is full but the pockets empty. You have no time to struggle with the oven
        and the watery spinach again. Don't worry, I'm here to help you.<br />
        <em>I couldn't find a better picture but don't worry, there's not meat involved!</em>

    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 small finely chopped onion</li>
        <li>1 fat crushed garlic cloved</li>
        <li>nnob of butter</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp of ground cumin</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp of sweet paprika</li>
        <li>pinch of chilli powder</li>
        <li>400g of drained and juice reserved can chopped tomatoes </li>
        <li>400g of drained and rinsed canned kidney beans</li>
        <li>1/2 vegetable stock cube</li>
        <li>2 squares of dark chocolate</li>
        <li>soured cream</li>
        <li>coriander <em>(if you like that)</em></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Put the onion, garlic, butter and spices in a microwaveable container, give it a quick stir,
            then heat in the microwave on High for 30-40 secs. Leave to stand for 1 min, then add the
            chopped tomatoes, beans, stock cube and chocolate.
        </li>
        <li>Cover with cling film and pierce 3 times. Place some kitchen paper on your microwave turntable,
            put the container on top and cook for 2 mins on High. Stir well and leave to stand for 1 min.
            If your chilli starts to dry out, add some of the reserved tomato juice, but remember that it wonâ€™t
            reduce as much in the microwave as it would on the hob.</li>
        <li>Cover and cook on Medium for a further 2 mins. Give it a good stir and allow to stand for 1 min before serving
            topped with soured cream and coriander, if you like.</li>
        <li>It should looks okay. I don't know, never tried that one. If you like it, well, that's great!</li>
    </ol>
