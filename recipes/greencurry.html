    <p class="description">As the name implies, Buddha Bowl is a vegetarian dish created in Toronto.
        It's a simple and healthy meal consisting of portions of several food mixed together.
        Since it's a trendy and instagramish dish, you've got to know some color theory
        to actually make it look pretty on your feed.

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Since we're lazy hungry people, just combine all the ingredients for the curry sauce
            in a blender and blend for 2 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>In a small bowl, coat the mushrooms in the olive oil. Set a pot fitted with a steaming basket and 1 inch of water in it over low heat.
            Place the broccoli and mushrooms in the basket and steam until the broccoli is tender, about 5 minutes. </li>
        <li>Assemble bowl by layering the veggies over the brown rice and drizzling with curry sauce.
            Garnish with Toasted coconut, cilantro and a squeeze of lime. </li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
