    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>As the name implies, Buddha Bowl is a vegetarian dish created in Toronto.
        It's a simple and healthy meal consisting of portions of several food mixed together.
        Since it's a trendy and instagramish dish, you've got to know some color theory
        to actually make it look pretty on your feed.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>For the meal</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups of cooked brown rice</li>
        <li>2 cups of broccoli florets</li>
        <li>1 cut of julienned carrots</li>
        <li>1/4 head purple thinly sliced cabbage</li>
        <li>8 sliced crimini mushrooms</li>
        <li>2 tsp of olive oil</li>
        <li>cilantro</li>
        <li>lime wedges</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the sauce</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup of raw cashews <em>(love it)</em></li>
        <li>2 tbsp of green curry paste <em>(be careful, it's FIRE)</em></li>
        <li>14oz can of coconut cream <em>(delicious)</em></li>
        <li>1 tbsp of lime juice</li>
        <li>2 tsp of fish sauce</li>
        <li>2 tsp of brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp of salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Since we're lazy hungry people, just combine all the ingredients for the curry sauce
            in a blender and blend for 2 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>In a small bowl, coat the mushrooms in the olive oil. Set a pot fitted with a steaming basket and 1 inch of water in it over low heat.
            Place the broccoli and mushrooms in the basket and steam until the broccoli is tender, about 5 minutes. </li>
        <li>Assemble bowl by layering the veggies over the brown rice and drizzling with curry sauce.
            Garnish with Toasted coconut, cilantro and a squeeze of lime. </li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
